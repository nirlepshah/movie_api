● Database is built using MongoDB and uploaded to MongoDB Atlas. <br />
● Database is connected to API deployed on Heroku<br />
● API includes user authenticationa, authorization code and data validation at relevant endpoints.

## Test the API

I tested endpoints in Postman to ensure that everything is working correctly between app and database

## Screenshot of few requests maded to the endpoints
