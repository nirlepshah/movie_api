    <h1>Web Application: myMovies</h1>
    <h2>Intro:</h2>
    <p>
      The API for the "movies" web application interacts with a database that
      stores data about different movies. The web application will provide users
      with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres.
      Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and
      create a list of their favorite movies.
